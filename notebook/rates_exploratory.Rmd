                      results = "hide")
```

Just a first pass at calcualting rates of sequestration for trees in crop and pasture lands. 

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(ggplot2)
library(splitstackshape)
library(stringr)
```


Pull in mean growth rates from [@feliciano2018agroforestry]

```{r}
growth_rates <- read_csv("../data/growth_rates.csv") %>% 
  group_by(REGION_UN, CP) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(mean))

```


Read in standing biomass histograms and do some data cleaning
```{r}
vars<-c("NAME_EN", "min", "BIOME_NAME", "ECONOMY", "POP_EST", "INCOME_GRP", "ISO_A3", "REGION_UN")

crop_hist <- read_csv("../data/crop_hist_25.csv") %>%
  select(vars) %>% drop_na() %>%
  mutate(b1 = str_sub(min, 2, -2)) %>%
  mutate(b1 = as.character(b1))

crop_hist <- cSplit(crop_hist, "b1", sep = ",", direction = "long")
crop_hist <- cSplit(crop_hist, "b1", sep = "=", direction = "wide")

pasture_hist <- read_csv("../data/pasture_hist_25.csv") %>%
  select(vars) %>% drop_na() %>%
  mutate(b1 = str_sub(min, 2, -2)) %>%
  mutate(b1 = as.character(b1))

pasture_hist <- cSplit(pasture_hist, "b1", sep = ",", direction = "long")
pasture_hist <- cSplit(pasture_hist, "b1", sep = "=", direction = "wide")
```


```{r}
GR_crop <- growth_rates %>% filter(CP == "crop") %>%
  select(REGION_UN, mean)

crop_country_GR <- crop_hist %>% left_join(GR_crop) %>%
  mutate(b1_1 = b1_1/2) %>%
  filter(b1_1 < 6) %>%
  mutate(annual_sequestration = b1_2 * mean) %>% # number of 1 ha pixels * GR per ha
  group_by(NAME_EN) %>%
  summarise(annual_sequestration = sum(annual_sequestration)/10^6) %>%
  mutate(CP = "crop")
```

```{r}
GR_pasture <- growth_rates %>% filter(CP == "pasture") %>%
  select(REGION_UN, mean)

pasture_country_GR <- pasture_hist %>% left_join(GR_pasture) %>%
  mutate(b1_1 = b1_1/2) %>%
  filter(b1_1 < 6) %>%
  mutate(annual_sequestration = b1_2 * mean) %>% # number of 1 ha pixels * GR per ha
  group_by(NAME_EN) %>%
  summarise(annual_sequestration = sum(annual_sequestration)/10^6) %>%
  mutate(CP = "pasture")
```

```{r}
simple_SR <- bind_rows(pasture_country_GR, crop_country_GR) %>%
  spread(CP, annual_sequestration) %>%
  mutate(total = crop + pasture)
```
